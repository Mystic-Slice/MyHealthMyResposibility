                    A dictionary meaning of Health indicates “a state of being free from illness”. Often the challenge 
                    is to keep in that state for longer period of time. Many of the comorbidities are acquired through 
                    lifestyle, type of work/work environment, and other environmental exposure. It is important to 
                    identify these factors that could adversely impact the person’s health to keep in this state 
                    for long run.
