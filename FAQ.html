                <div class="Question">From which foods can we get carbohydrates?<hr></div>
                A:Milk products and fruits, whole grain breads and cereals, table sugar, starchy vegetables,
                and legumes. Carbohydrates are called "simple" or "complex," depending on how fast your body digests 
                and absorbs the sugar. You get simple carbohydrates from fruits, milk products, and table sugar.
                Complex carbohydrates include whole grain breads and cereals, starchy vegetables, and legumes. 
                Complex carbohydrates and some simple carbohydrates provide vitamins, minerals, and fiber. 
                Products made with refined sugar provide little nutrition. It is wise to limit these products.

                <div class="Question">Can caffeine be consumed safely?<hr></div>
                It is safe for adults to consume caffeine, as long as it is consumed in moderation, according 
                to the Food and Drug AdministrationOff Site Icon (FDA).To keep caffeine at safe levels in 
                the body, doctors recommend limiting intake to no more than 200 mg per day, according to the 
                FDA. Two 5-ounce cups of coffee contains about 200 mg of caffeine, for example.If you are consuming 
                too much caffeine, try to cut back slowly because caffeine can cause withdrawal symptoms, 
                including headache, tiredness and depression, according to the FDA.

                <div class="Question">Can a healthy diet help us avoid disease?<hr></div>
                Absolutely. The Harvard studies indicate that the correct dietary choices that's moderate 
                consumption of lots of vegetables and fruits, good (unsaturated) fats and good (unrefined) carbs
                in conjunction with regular exercise (and of course avoiding smoking) would prevent about 82 percent 
                of heart attacks, about 70 percent of strokes, over 90 percent of type 2 diabetes, and over 70 percent 
                of colon cancer. By comparison, the best statin drugs can reduce heart attacks by about 20 or 30 percent.

                <div class="Question">Is the BMI a fair measure?<hr></div>
                The BMI gives a pretty accurate measure of body fat, but the scale has limits. It's really only 
                applicable to "ordinary" people 20 to 65 years of age. The BMI is not an appropriate measure for 
                children, for the elderly, for pregnant and nursing women, or for heavily muscled athletes. 
                For the rest of us, however, it does give a snapshot of how fat we are.

                <div class="Question">What is a safe rate for me to lose weight?<hr></div>
                A safe rate for losing weight is basically dependent upon each individual person. We focus 
                mostly on their body mass index or BMI to determine how quickly someone or the expectation 
                how someone should lose weight. With a medical weight loss or non surgical weight loss, typically 
                one to two pounds a week is a healthy rate to lose weight.

                <div class="Question">What is a "healthy diet"?<hr></div>
                A healthy eating pattern is one that provides enough of each essential nutrient from 
                nutrient-dense foods, contains a variety of foods from all of the basic food groups, 
                and focuses on balancing calories consumed with calories expended to help you achieve 
                and sustain a healthy weight. This eating pattern limits intake of solid fats, sugar, 
                salt (sodium) and alcohol.

                <div class="Question">How can I burn off my stored body fat?<hr></div>
                We all need some body fat, but if stored fat is excessive it may increase risk of diet-related 
                diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and some cancers. This is particularly true if 
                excess fat is in the abdominal area. According to the CDC, a body mass index, or BMI, of 25 or 
                higher is an indication that your weight may be unhealthy.
